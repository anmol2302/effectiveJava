ch -2 -:
  -  A volatile modifier is used that any thread excess the variable will have the most recent changes, since microprocessor does not cache the variable.
      this modifier is used when variable is shared between multiple threads...
  -  it is important to have a readResolve() method in singleton classes to avoid multiple instances on deserialization.
  -  it is good to use getInstance method with private constructor to symbolize meaning of instantiating the constructor,
  -  but the shortcoming of using getInstance method is that it cant be subclassed.
  -  Use builder pattern when you have too many variable to initialize(Telescopic pattern or javBeans pattern(setters and getters)) , it is easy to read.
  -  No need to use singleton class who has dependency on other underlying resources..
  -  garbage collector is dominant to weakHashMap so any key in map that is not refrenced is removed by the garbage collector but opposite in HashMap.
  -  always use try with resources in prefer to try with finally since they provide more readability and provide more clear exceptions they extends to Autoclosable class.
